# Movie and Song CRUD Application with PostgreSQL and MongoDB

## Project Overview

This project is a **CRUD application** developed using **NestJS** to manage movie and song data. It integrates both **PostgreSQL** (via TypeORM) and **MongoDB** (via Mongoose), enabling CRUD operations on both relational and NoSQL databases.

The **Movies module** utilizes **PostgreSQL** to manage structured data with relational integrity, while the **Songs module** uses **MongoDB** for flexible, schema-less storage of song data.

## Key Features

### Movies Module (PostgreSQL)
- Manage movie details such as title, director, release date, genres, and rating.
- Perform CRUD operations on movies:
  - `POST /movies`: Create a new movie.
  - `GET /movies`: Fetch all movies.
  - `GET /movies/:id`: Fetch a movie by its ID.
  - `PUT /movies/:id`: Update an existing movie.
  - `DELETE /movies/:id`: Delete a movie.
- Uses **PostgreSQL** for structured data with relational integrity.

### Songs Module (MongoDB)
- Manage song details such as title, artist, genre, release date, and lyrics.
- Perform CRUD operations on songs:
  - `POST /songs`: Create a new song.
  - `GET /songs`: Fetch all songs.
  - `GET /songs/:id`: Fetch a song by its ID.
  - `PUT /songs/:id`: Update an existing song.
  - `DELETE /songs/:id`: Delete a song.
- Uses **MongoDB** for flexible, schema-less storage of song data.

## Database Integration
- **PostgreSQL** is used for the **Movies** module to store structured data with relational integrity.
- **MongoDB** is used for the **Songs** module, providing flexibility in handling semi-structured data such as lyrics and multiple artists.

## Technologies Used:
- **NestJS** for the backend framework.
- **PostgreSQL** for the Movies module.
- **MongoDB** for the Songs module.
- **TypeORM** for PostgreSQL integration.
- **Mongoose** for MongoDB integration.
